Deep-learning-model-using-in-python
-------------------------------------

* Implemented Convolution Neural network from scratch (with backpropagation) and basic ML Algorithm 
(KNN, logistic regression, and SVM) in Python.
* Used Transfer learning on AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet18, Inception v3 for fine tuning and feature extraction with 
PyTorch on AWS.
