Deep-learning-model-using-in-python
-------------------------------------

* Implemented Convolution Neural network from scratch (with backpropagation) and basic ML Algorithm 
(KNN, logistic regression, and SVM) in Python.
* Used Transfer learning on AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet18, Inception v3 for fine tuning and feature extraction with 
PyTorch on AWS.


### Convolution Neural Network
* Before using, we need to download the dataset and adjust the dataset path in layer/dataset.py.
* run run_cifar100.py.

### ML Algorithm
* In each folder, use the run_XXX.py

### Transfer Learning
* Before using, we need to download the dataset and adjust the dataset path in dataset.py.
* run feature.py for feature extractor.
* run fintune.py for fine tune.
